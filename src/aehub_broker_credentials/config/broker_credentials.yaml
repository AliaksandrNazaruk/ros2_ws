# Broker Credentials Node - Default Configuration
#
# This file provides default configuration for broker_credentials_node.
# The launch file automatically loads these defaults, so you don't need to
# pass config_service_url and api_key as launch arguments.
#
# Usage:
#   - Edit the values below (especially api_key - keep secrets OUT of git)
#   - Launch without arguments: ros2 launch aehub_broker_credentials broker_credentials.launch.py
#   - Or override via launch args if needed
#
# This package is designed to keep the node isolated from external environment.
# Defaults are automatically read from this YAML (installed under share/aehub_broker_credentials/config/).
